# My Portfolio - React Assignment

## Description
The goal of this challenge was to use React.js to create a portfolio that could be used to promote myself as a developer. For this challenge, I chose to use Bootstrap to style my portfolio, and the react-icons npm to import an icon for GitHub and LinkedIn. This project makes use of multiple React components in order to easily style my portfolio. In addition, I found it necessary to also create an extra component for my contact form. My portfolio is comprised of a header component with navigation links nested inside, a footer component, and pages titled: "About", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume". For this challenge, I found it necessary to create a separate JS file within my components directory that contains an array of objects titled "projects". I was then able to use this to use the project component to create individual content cards for each of my projects.

## Technologies Used
I made use of the react-icons npm package via installation using the terminal. Documentation for this npm package is found at [react-icons link](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons?tab=readme-ov-file#readme).  

This website was styled using Bootstrap. Documentation can be found at [Bootstrap Link](https://getbootstrap.com/).
